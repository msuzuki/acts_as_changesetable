This plugin turns the named resource into a changeset tracked resource. 

script/generate changeable_history Foo 
  This will create a migration called FooHistory, and a resource FooHistory that 
  has "acts_as_changeable_history :same_as_changeable => true"

  After running, add a line to your Foo model: "acts_as_changeable"
